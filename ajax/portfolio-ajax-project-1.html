      <p>This project was a code along inside a React Udemy course. Building it gave me a strong, well-needed foundation in React and Redux. It was also this project that taught me the importance
         of planning out the architecture of a website as well as writing neat and organized code. In addition to that, throughout building this 
         project I learned and exercised the ability to store data in firebase, authenticate user data, and integrate stripe payments.</p>
